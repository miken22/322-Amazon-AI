# 322-Amazon-AI
Java implementation of a server based board game Amazons

TODO:

Need to implement search methods (A*, ID, min-max etc)

	- Improve performance by implementing a beam search for mid-game, adjust depth for end-game

Need to implement heuristic functions(s)
	
	- Improve strength of heuristic, more efficient computation?
	
Adjust successor generation: more efficient methods or possibly more compact/efficient board representation
