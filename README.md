# 322-Amazon-AI
Java implementation of a server based board game Amazons

Started the creation of a Player with game client and connects to the rooms. Tries to join a room - currently does not work as server is not up. (DONE)


Started creating a board class, initialize to initial state, create methods for moving (DONE)

Need to create a GUI to display the board, pieces, chat, move log. (DONE)

Need to test connection once the server goes up (DONE)

Need to implement search methods (A*, ID, min-max etc)

Need to implement heuristic functions(s) - Zach(MinMove)

Need to create the XML move formatting - Mike

This should be enough to get started. The progress on the first two points is on my branch MikeDev, let me know if anything else comes to mind.

Mark off what parts are being does so that we can keep track of everything.
